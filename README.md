For this project, we use the dataset from NYC Opendata about the restaurant inspection results in NYC. In the report, we discuss about the scores and grades of inspections, the violation types, as well as the cuisine types. We also draw graphs to explore the relationships between some of the variables in the dataset. There is a Shiny link included to help users better interact with this report and get to know more about what interests them.
